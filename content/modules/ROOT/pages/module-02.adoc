= Model Deployment and Configuration

In this module, we will quickly review the different OpenShift AI components, and learn how to deploy a model with it.

[#connection-verify]
== Getting connected to OpenShift AI

For the purposes of this workshop session, we have provisioned an OpenShift Container Platform cluster for each participant, with Red Hat OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab has a full admin access (`cluster-admin``) to their cluster to be able to do their work and check the various configurations.

If you are using this instructions through the workshop, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The {rhoai} Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Click on the `Login with OpenShift` button:

* Enter your credentials (as detailed above)

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), your browser might display a scary message such as:

* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you properly connected to the {rhoai} Dashboard Application!

We are now ready to start!.
