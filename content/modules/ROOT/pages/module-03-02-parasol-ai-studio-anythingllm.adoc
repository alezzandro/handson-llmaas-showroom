= Module 3.2: AnythingLLM

== AnythingLLM Workbench

We will be using AnythingLLM to explore the following use-cases:

* Generic Chatbot
* Conversation with a PDF document

=== Creating the AnythingLLM application

If not done already as part of the introduction to Parasol AI Studio, go to the Parasol AI Studio site at https://my-ai-studio-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain} and login with *{user}/{password}*.

Now you can create the **AnythingLLM** application by following these steps:

* Click on `Create an application`
+

* Under `Type` select `AnythingLLM`
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-application_options.png[width="100%"]
* Leave the version as is and use `anythingllm` as the name
* Click on `Create application`
+
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-create_application_2.png[width="100%"]
+
The application will be starting
+

+
After a short while a link to open the application it will appear

* Click on `open` and login with *{user}/{password}*.


=== Quick Tour

After you have started the application you will be greated with the main dashboard of AnythingLLM.

==== Settings

You can access the settings by click on the `wrench` symbol on the lower left.

To leave the settings, click on the `return` icon also on the lower left.

While there are many interesting areas to explore on the AnythingLLM settings we will focus on the LLM and the Vector Database for now.

===== LLM

The LLM settings can be found at `AI Providers/LLM`

[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-anythingllm_settings_llm.png[width="100%"]

The information display includes:

* `LLM Provider`: We are using `Generic OpenAI` for this Lab. 
* `URL`: This is preconfigured with the URL on 3scale API Management.
* `API Key`: Please note that this is the same key as you have used in xref:module-02-01-code-assistant.adoc#code-asst[Module 1.1: Coding with AI], If you haven't run this module, it was automatically created for you.
* `Chat Model Name`: This has been determined automatically from the Base URL, in our case `granite-3.3-8b-instruct`.
* `Token context window`: Set to 4096 by default
* `Max Tokens`: Set to 2048 by default 

===== Vector Database

The Vector Database settings can be found at `AI Providers/Vector Database`

[.bordershadow]

* `Vector Database Provider`: For this lab we are using Weaviate
* `Weaviate Endpoint`: Cluster internal URL to the Weaviate service deployed on OpenShift.
* `API Key`: Left empty as we are not using API keys for Weaviate

=== Chat Bot

Now that we got familiar with AnythingLLM it is time for some conversation about AI with a Chat Bot.

First, create a workspace by selecting `+ New Workspace` and entering *Red Hat OpenShift AI* followed by `Save`.

[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-anythingllm_create_workspace.png[width="100%"]

Let's start by asking *What is Red Hat OpenShift AI*

[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-anythingllm_chat_first_message.png[width="100%"]

and the *Chat Bot* will come back with an answer.

Feel free to ask it anything that comes to your mind.

=== Chat Bot with RAG

To have a more qualified talk we will be embedding a PDF into the chat using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

For demonstration purpose you can use the PDF https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.25/pdf/getting_started_with_red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/Red_Hat_OpenShift_AI_Self-Managed-2.25-Getting_started_with_Red_Hat_OpenShift_AI_Self-Managed-en-US.pdf[Red Hat OpenShift AI Self-Managed], download this document to your PC.

To embed the document click on the `paperclip` icon in the chat window and upload the document

[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-anythingllm_chat_document_attach.png[width="100%"]

The next question to ask is *How can I get started with OpenShift AI*, also this will be answered by the chat bot.

Please note that you will also get information about citations from the embedded document.

[.bordershadow]

Explore this functionality by embedding other documents of your liking!

Time to checkout what was stored on the Vector Database:

* Open the OpenShift Console at https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain} and login with *{user}/{password}*
* Open a `Web Terminal` by clicking on `>_` on the upper right side
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-web_terminal.png[width="100%"]
* To start the terminal select `{user}-parasol-ai` as the project, click on `Start`
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-web_terminal_initialize.png[width="100%"]
and a `bash` terminal should be shown
+
[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-web_terminal_prompt.png[width="100%"]

As a first step, let's get some information about the schema in the the Weaviate Vector database by running the following command

[source,role=execute]
----
curl -s http://weaviate.weaviate.svc/v1/schema | jq
----

You should see the following information:

[.bordershadow]
image::03/02-weaviate_schema.png[width="100%"]

Notice that the class was derived from the name we gave the chat earlier. Note down the value for `class` as we will need it to query Weaviate for entries.

Weaviate offers a REST and a GraphQL interface, for ease-of-use we will use REST for the moment to query all objects available:
[source,role=execute]
----
curl -s http://weaviate.weaviate.svc/v1/objects | jq | less
----
This should return information like this

== Recap: What you just did

Now we stepped into the shoes of a *Knowledge Worker*

✅ Used an LLM for a Chat Bot application

✅ Embedded documents into the Chat Bot using RAG.

Notice that everything has been setup automatically for the user with no hassle.
