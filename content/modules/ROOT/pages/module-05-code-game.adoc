= Game Time

You're still the developer. Now that your AI assistant is wired up, it's time to get your hands dirty - by building a simple game using Roo's help. In this module, you're not solving a business-critical problem… yet! You’re exploring, experimenting, and building confidence with AI-assisted coding through something fun: a simple game.

== Choose a Game to Build

Pick **one** of the following lightweight game projects, available in both Python and Bash:

. **Rock Paper Scissors**: Play rock, paper, scissors against the computer!
. **Word Scramble**: The program scrambles a word and the user has to guess what it is.
. **Simple Quiz Game**: The program asks a few trivia questions and then gives a final score.

You only need to pick one - but feel free to try more if you have time.

== Open Your Starter File

From the file explorer, navigate to the `game_starters` directory:

image:code/file_explorer.png[]

Open the game file of your preference, in the language of your choice.

The top half of the file includes working game code. The bottom half of the file includes instructions as comments to extend the game application. 

== Use Roo to Build and Enhance

Once you have opened the file you wish to work on, click the `Roo` extension tab again on the left-hand side of the VS Code window. You may toggle between the `Explorer` and `Roo` tabs as you need.

Follow the guidance in the file comments, or ask your own questions - this is your playground.

IMPORTANT: Ensure any text that does not contribute to the game code stays as a comment. 

== A Note About Roo

You may notice that Roo is not the same experience as ChatGPT.

Roo Code isn't just a chatbot — it’s an AI coding assistant built into your development environment. While tools like ChatGPT focus on freeform conversations, Roo Code is designed to help you interact directly with your code in a structured and developer-friendly way. Roo will also plan out tasks by default before acting. 

Roo Code works best when you're iterating on *existing* code or working with a clear structure. It's not always ideal for starting a project from scratch or when you're unsure where to begin. In those cases, you may get better results by sketching out basic logic yourself first, or using a simpler AI assistant (like ChatGPT) to help brainstorm before returning to Roo.

== Run (and Play) Your Game

Once complete, save your file(s) that you wish to test.

We will use the Terminal capability within VSCode to test our applications. To open a terminal session navigate to `Terminal` -> `New Terminal` from the hamburger menu in the navigation bar of the VSCode app. Or you may press kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[`].

Navigate to the file's folder:

Example [substitute the correct path to your file]

[source,console]
----
cd /home/dev/rhone_code/game_templates/rock_paper_scissors/
----

Follow the instructions for the right code language:

=== Python (.py)

Run the following command (substitue your filename):

[source,console]
----
python your_filename.py
----

=== Bash (.sh)

Make the file executable (you only need to do this once). Substitute your filename:

[source,console]
----
chmod +x your_filename.sh
----

Run the following command (substitue your filename):

[source,console]
----
./your_filename.sh
----

=== Troubleshooting

**If you see a "command not found" or "permission denied" error**:

* Double-check the file name is spelled correctly

* Make sure you’re in the correct directory (ls to list files)

* For .sh files, try `bash yourfile.sh` if ``./yourfile.sh` doesn't work.

**Other error or application isn't working as expected**:

* Use your code assistant to help you debug

* Feed the errors or explain any issues in the extension chat and have the AI help you correct your code

== Stuck? Peek at a Solution

Solutions are available here:

[source,console]
----
~/rhone_code/game_solutions/
----

Use the execution instructions in the above sections to run the code for any of the provided game programs!

== Taking the Next Step

You've now used Roo in a real, yet low-pressure, context - scaffolding, editing, testing and debugging a working application!

In the next activity, we'll bring our new set of skills into a Kubernetes deployment context.
