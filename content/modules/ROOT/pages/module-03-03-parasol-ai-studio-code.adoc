= Module 3.3: Code Server

== Code Server

In this exercise we will use a lighter version of `VS Code` running in a container in combination with *Continue* similar to the exercise in xref:module-02-01-code-assistant.adoc#code-asst[Module 2.1: Code Assistant]

=== Creating the Code Server application

Follow these simple steps to create the Code Server application

* Click on `Create a new application`
* Select `Code Server for Parasol AI Studio`
* Enter `code` as the name
* Hit `Create Application`

The application is shown as **starting** now

A few moments later an **open** link will appear

Open the link will take you to the **Code Server** dashboard.

=== Cloning the Git repository

As a first action we need to clone the git repository containing the application code we would like to implement.

Navigate to **View/Terminal**

In the terminal enter the following command

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://gitea-gitea.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/studentX/handson-llmaas-code-development-2
----

=== Use Continue for code implementation

On the file explorer go to **SRC/handson-llmaas-code-development-2** and click on **app.py**

This will open the code in the editor.

Now we are going to interact with *Continue* by clicking on the icon on the left hand side bar.

Mark the **get_task** method starting from `@app.route` until `pass` and press `Ctrl-L`.

This will copy the text into the *Continue* chat window:

Let us inspect the model that is used for *Continue* by selecting `granite-8b-c...` dropdown box below the chat file and on `granite-8b-code-instruct-128k` click on the settings icon.

Here you will see the following information:

* **model**: We are using `granite-8b-code-instruct-128k`
* **apiBase**: The URL of the model is https://granite-8b-code-instruct-maas-apicast-production.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/v1
* **apiKey**: This has been generated for us as this is the first time we are using this model.

Now you are ready to run the same steps as in xref:module-02-02-code-development.adoc#code-development[Module 2.2: Code Assistant]

== Recap: What you just did

Now we stepped into the shoes of *Developer* (again)

✅ Used an LLM as a *Code Assistant*

Notice that everything has been setup automatically for the user with no hassle.
