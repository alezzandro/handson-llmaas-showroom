= Module 3.4: Docling

== Docling

In this exercise we will use *Docling Serve* to convert documents to a format that is more convenient during a tokenization process like Markdown.

=== Creating the Docling application

Follow these simple steps to create the *Docling Web Client* application

* Click on `Create a new application`
* Select `Docling for Parasol AI Studio`
* Enter `docling` as the name
* Hit `Create Application`

The application is shown as **starting** now

=== Processing documents with the Docling Web Client

In the **Docling Web Client** under **Input Sources** enter the following URL:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
https://www.redhat.com/en
----

The click on **Process URL(s)** leaving all options at default, this will convert the HTML site to Markdown.

Now experiment with other document input and output formats, you can also download the results.

== Recap: What you just did

✅ Used Docling to convert documents for later tokenization

Docling offers much more functionality that what can be demonstrated as part of this lab:

* REST API for automation
* Advanced PDF processing powered by a specialized ML model
* Asynchrounous processing of documents for data ingestion pipelines
* Conversion from HTML, PDF, Excel etc to Markdown, HTML
