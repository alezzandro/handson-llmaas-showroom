=== Generating images with Stable Diffusion

On first usage you will be greated with a disclaimer, please click on **Accept** to proceed.

Under **Parameters/Prompt** enter the following text

[source,role="execute"]
----

----

To have a higher quality image, use the following settings:

* **Guidance Scale**: 16
* **Number of Inference Steps**: 80

You can leave the remaining settings as is.

Now click on **Generate the image**
