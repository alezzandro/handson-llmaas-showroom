= Coding with AI

Welcome to the next stage of our journey!

Now, you become an AI application developer. Your job: build smarter, faster - with a little help from a language model.

== Why Code Assistants Matter

You're not just here to write code - you're here to collaborate with an **AI-powered teammate**.

Modern code assistants can:

* **Understand Full Project Context**: Assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Roo can read across files and directories, understanding how your code fits together.

* **Edit code with Natural Language**: You can describe a change—like “add error handling here” or “convert this to async”—and assistants like Roo, Continue, or CodeWhisperer will apply it intelligently.

* **Proactively Suggest Improvements**: They catch bugs, highlight inefficiencies, and recommend best-practice patterns.

* **Automate Tedious Tasks**: From generating unit tests and docstrings to scaffolding boilerplate or renaming variables across a project—they take care of the grunt work so you can focus on logic and design.

These assistants don’t just write code - they understand your project and help you build better software faster. And the best part? Most of them work seamlessly inside popular IDE's like Visual Studio Code, so you don’t need to switch tools to get started.

Let's get set up.

== Step 1: Setting Up Your Cloud Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) with OpenShift Dev Spaces

As a developer, your environment should be fast, consistent, and ready to go for your work. That is what OpenShift Dev Spaces delivers: instant access to pre-configured, containerized workspaces — all running securely on your OpenShift cluster.

You could also easily leverage our exposed model API endpoint in your local environment as a developer. However, your company has specific restrictions and require you to work within the OpenShift cluster environment.

=== Access OpenShift Dev Spaces Console

Your platform engineer has provided you a direct URL to the Dev Spaces console to begin your work.

1. Navigate to console: https://devspaces.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://devspaces.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}]

We have a VSCode workspace ready for your use, with the required dependencies. As a developer, you can also create your own workspace without needing to install or configure anything locally. There may however, be some restrictions put in place by your admin around resource limitations or only using approved devfiles (yaml files used to instantiate new workspaces). 

2. Launch the pre-created workspace by clicking `Open`

After a moment, you'll see the VSCode interface running in your browser. If prompted, click "Trust" when asked about the authors. We're friendly, I promise!

Inside your workspace, you'll find a cloned GitHub repository. This is where you will build and refine. Nothing else needs to be configured locally, everything you need is in place.

Before we dive into the code, let's meet **Roo**.

== Step 3: Add Roo, Your Coding Teammate

**Roo Code** is an AI extension that integrates into VS Code. Unlike traditional code completion tools or chatbots, Roo is an intelligent, task-driven assistant that you can talk to. You can ask Roo to perform actions like:

**“Add logging to this function”**

**“Generate a unit test for this file”**

**“Refactor this into smaller components”**

**“Explain what this code does”**

And Roo will do it—right in your project, with full awareness of your codebase. 

Many leading code extensions operate in similar ways, and Roo is a great **open-source** example of what AI coding can help us be capable of. 

=== Install Roo

Select the bottom navigation item on the left-hand side to open up the extensions marketplace.

In the search bar, search for **Roo Code**. You'll see it as the top option, as shown below:

image::code/roo_code.png[]

Click **Install**

You may get another trust verification message. Select **Trust Publisher & Install**.

Once installed, click on the arrow next to `Uninstall -> Install Specific Version` as seen below. We are going to select a specific version to install since things move so quickly around here!

Click **Install Specific Version...**

You will see a drop-down appear with different versions. Please select **v3.25.6**.

Once done installing the proper version, click **Reload Window**

You've now installed Roo - next, let's connect it to your private LLM.

== Step 4: Connect Roo to Your Granite Model

Navigate to the **Roo sidebar icon** in the left-hand side navigation panel:

image::code/roo_sidebar.png[]

We will do two things in this module:

1. Connect to our Granite model within our company's MaaS platform
2. Use our model's "brain" to help us build a Kubernetes deployment

In order to connect our model to the Roo Code extension we must provide the extension our model's endpoint URL and API key from our MaaS application in the previous module.

NOTE: If needed, go back to the developer portal and the application created in the previous module to retrieve the credentials: https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain},window=_blank].

=== Enter Connection Details

1. API Provider field: **OpenAI Compatible**

2. Base URL: Endpoint URL from our MaaS application. **Add /v1 to the end of the URL.**

3. API Key: The API Key from the MaaS application.

4. Model: Select the Granite model from the dropdown (this will populate after inputting the above URL and API Key information)

5. Leave all other fields in their default positions. Select `Let's go!` at the bottom of the form.

== You're Ready to Code with AI

You've now:

* Set up a cloud IDE
* Connected to a private enterprise LLM
* Installed an AI assistant that can refactor, edit and explain your code!

Next, you will use Roo to help you develop a little fun game to get warmed up.
